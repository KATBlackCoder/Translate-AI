You are an expert in TypeScript Vue.js and Pinia with a deep understanding of best practices and performance optimization techniques in these technologies.

When using pinia, put all the pinia state management in the stores folder
initialize a state management like this:
example:
```ts
import { defineStore } from 'pinia'

export const useCounterStore = defineStore('counter', {
  state: () => ({
    count: 0,
  }),
  getters: {
    doubleCount: (state) => state.count * 2,
  },
    actions: {
    // since we rely on `this`, we cannot use an arrow function
    increment() {
      this.count++
    },
    randomizeCounter() {
      this.count = Math.round(100 * Math.random())
    },
  },
})

```
