# Project Progress - AI Game Translator

Last Updated: {{Current Date/Time}} <!-- Replace with actual date/time -->

## Overall Status:
Phase 1 (Project Setup & Core UI Shell for Project Translation) is complete. Core technology stack is defined, essential frontend/backend dependencies are configured, Tauri plugins are registered, the basic UI shell for project selection is implemented with Pinia state management (`stores/project.ts`), Nuxt configuration is optimized, and Inter-Process Communication (IPC) between frontend and backend is verified. 

**Single-Text Translation Feature (Phase 2 from original plan) has been REMOVED/DEFERRED to prioritize batch project translation.** The backend Ollama client and associated Tauri command (`translate_text_command`) might be reused or adapted if this feature is re-introduced.

**Backend Refactoring Complete:** The Rust backend command structure has been reorganized. Commands are now in the `src-tauri/src/commands/` directory, with modules like `project.rs` and `translation.rs`. The `translate_text_command` has been moved to `commands::translation` and `lib.rs` updated accordingly.

## Completed Milestones:

*   **Documentation & Planning:** (All initial docs created and updated as needed - will be updated again to reflect removal of single-text translation)
    *   Comprehensive **App Design Document** (`@memory-bank/translator_app_design_document.md`).
    *   **Recommended Tech Stack** (`@memory-bank/recommended_tech_stack.md`).
    *   Initial **Implementation Plan** (`@memory-bank/implementation_plan.md`).
    *   **Architecture Overview** (`@memory-bank/architecture.md`).
    *   **Frontend Architecture** (`@memory-bank/frontend_architecture.md`).
    *   Associated Cursor memory bank rules established and updated.

*   **Phase 1: Project Setup & Core UI Shell (Focus on Project Translation - COMPLETE):**
    *   Basic Nuxt 3 project structure established.
    *   **Frontend Dependencies (`package.json`):** Verified, updated, and refined.
    *   **Backend Dependencies & Setup (`src-tauri`):** Core crates and Tauri plugins configured and registered.
    *   **Nuxt Configuration (`nuxt.config.ts`):** Optimized for Tauri integration, resolved CSS loading issues.
    *   **Core UI Implementation (`pages/index.vue`):** UI for project selection via `ProjectSelector.vue` implemented.
    *   **Frontend State Management (Pinia):** `stores/project.ts` created (Setup Stores) and integrated for project workflow. (`stores/translation.ts` to be reviewed/removed).
    *   **IPC Test:** Successfully verified communication between Nuxt frontend and Rust backend (`simple_ipc_test` command).

*   **Phase 2: Core Single-Text Translation (Offline AI - Ollama) (REMOVED/DEFERRED)**
    *   (Details of completed sub-tasks for this phase are now moot as the feature is deferred. The `translate_text_command` and Ollama client in Rust exist but are not currently used by the frontend.)

*   **Backend Code Structure Refactoring (Part of initiating original Phase 3):**
    *   Created `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` to manage command modules.
    *   Created `src-tauri/src/commands/project.rs` for project-related commands.
    *   Created `src-tauri/src/commands/translation.rs`.
    *   Moved `translate_text_command` from `lib.rs` to `commands::translation::translate_text_command`.
    *   Updated `lib.rs` to declare the `commands` module and correctly reference the moved command in the `invoke_handler`.
    *   Updated `implementation_plan.md` to reflect the new `.rs` file naming convention (e.g., `project.rs` instead of `project_commands.rs`).

*   **Frontend Refactoring - Layout & Header (Part of initiating original Phase 3):**
    *   Created `components/AppHeader.vue` with application title and a placeholder settings button.
    *   Created `layouts/default.vue` and integrated `AppHeader.vue` into it, establishing a basic page structure with a header and main content slot.
    *   Refined `layouts/default.vue` to leverage Nuxt 3's auto-import for components (removed explicit `AppHeader` import).

*   **Frontend Refactoring - Page Structure (Part of initiating original Phase 3 - Now Refocused):**
    *   `components/SingleTextTranslator.vue` and its integration into `pages/index.vue` have been removed.
    *   `components/ProjectSelector.vue` (formerly `ProjectTranslator.vue`) created for project selection.
    *   `pages/index.vue` now focuses on `ProjectSelector.vue`.
*   **Original Phase 3, Task 1: Project Selection (Rust & Frontend) (COMPLETE):**
    *   Implemented `select_project_folder_command` in `src-tauri/src/commands/project.rs`.
    *   Created Pinia store `stores/project.ts` (using Setup Store syntax) with state and actions for folder selection.
    *   Connected store to `components/ProjectTranslator.vue` for UI interaction.
*   **Original Phase 3, Task 2: RPG Maker MV Project Detection (Rust Backend) (COMPLETE):**
    *   Core detection logic moved to `core::game_detection` module.
    *   `select_project_folder_command` returns path and detection result.
    *   Frontend store and component updated to handle and display detection status.
*   **Original Phase 3, Task 3: File Parsing & String Extraction (Rust Backend) (COMPLETE):**
    *   The `extract_project_strings_command` is defined in `commands/project.rs` and registered.
    *   RPG Maker MV parsing module structure implemented in `src-tauri/src/core/rpgmv/`.
    *   All planned RPG Maker MV JSON file parsers (`Actors`, `Items`, `Armors`, `Weapons`, `Skills`, `Enemies`, `CommonEvents`, `Troops`, `System`, `MapXXX`, `MapInfos`, `Classes`, `States`) and associated refactorings for string extraction are implemented. (`Tilesets.json` parsing deferred).
    *   The core dispatch logic in `src-tauri/src/core/rpgmv/project.rs` (function `extract_translatable_strings_from_project`) now correctly calls all individual file parsers.
    *   **Integration Testing for Parsers (COMPLETE):**
        *   All Rust integration tests for individual RPG Maker MV JSON file types (`Actors.json`, `Armors.json`, `Classes.json`, `CommonEvents.json`, `Enemies.json`, `Items.json`, `MapInfos.json`, `MapXXX.json`, `Skills.json`, `States.json`, `System.json`, `Troops.json`, `Weapons.json`) have been successfully refactored into separate files under `src-tauri/src/tests/integration/`.
        *   The common helper function `setup_and_extract_all_strings` has been centralized in `src-tauri/src/tests/common_test_utils.rs`.
        *   All 18 tests are confirmed PASSING after these refactorings.

## Current Focus (Effectively New Phase 2):

*   **RPG Maker MV Project Translation (Batch) - (Formerly Phase 3)**
    *   **Task 4: Frontend for Batch Workflow (Refactored - Core Structure COMPLETE):**
        *   `stores/settings.ts` created to manage `languageOptions` and `engineOptions`. **(COMPLETE)**.
        *   `stores/project.ts` focuses on project selection, detection, string extraction, and navigation. Its `$reset()` calls `translationStore.$resetBatchState()`. **(COMPLETE)**.
        *   `stores/translation.ts` focuses on batch translation operation (state, action). (Currently defines shared `TranslatableStringEntry` & `TranslatedStringEntry` interfaces). **(COMPLETE)**.
        *   `pages/index.vue` uses `ProjectSelector.vue`. **(COMPLETE)**.
        *   `ProjectSelector.vue` triggers extraction via `projectStore`. **(COMPLETE)**.
        *   `ProjectStringsReview.vue` uses `projectStore` for strings, `settingsStore` for options, and `translationStore` for batch action/state. **(COMPLETE)**.
        *   `ProjectStringsResult.vue` uses `translationStore` for results. **(COMPLETE)**.
        *   `pages/project.vue` orchestrates review/results using all three stores as needed. **(COMPLETE)**.
    *   **Task 5: Batch Translation Logic (Manual Testing & Refinement - COMPLETE):**
        *   Successfully completed manual testing of the end-to-end project selection, string extraction, review, batch translation (Ollama), and results display workflow with the refactored UI components.
        *   Core functionality is verified. UI/UX is deemed acceptable for this stage.
        *   Minor UI polish (e.g., transitions, disabling more elements during loading) noted for future enhancement (Phase 6).
        *   Error handling for Ollama unavailability and invalid project paths confirmed.
        *   Performance observation: Ollama translation can become slow when processing a very large number of strings (e.g., >1000). This will be a consideration for future optimization (Phase 6 or later).
        *   Some specific error conditions (e.g., individual string translation errors, corrupted project files) were not tested due to lack of specific test data but can be addressed later if encountered or during more targeted testing phases.
    *   **Task 6: Reconstruct Translated Files (Rust):**
        *   **Sub-Task 6.1: Define `TranslatedStringEntryFromFrontend` Struct (Rust) - COMPLETE**
        *   **Sub-Task 6.2: Implement `reconstruct_translated_project_files` Tauri Command (Rust) - COMPLETE - Basic command structure with placeholder logic**
        *   **Sub-Task 6.3: Implement Core Reconstruction Logic Dispatcher (Rust) - COMPLETE - Dispatcher implemented; specific reconstructor calls are placeholders returning `CoreError::Unimplemented`**
        *   Sub-Task 6.4: Implement Specific Reconstructor Functions (Rust)
            *   `Actors.json` reconstructor: COMPLETE (includes `note` field, uses `update_value_at_path` helper, unit tests passed)
            *   `Items.json` reconstructor: COMPLETE (uses `update_value_at_path` helper, unit tests passed)
            *   `Armors.json` reconstructor: COMPLETE (uses `update_value_at_path` helper, unit tests passed)
            *   `Weapons.json` reconstructor: COMPLETE (uses `update_value_at_path` helper, unit tests passed)
            *   `Skills.json` reconstructor: COMPLETE (uses `update_value_at_path` helper, unit tests passed)
            *   `Enemies.json` reconstructor: COMPLETE (uses `update_value_at_path` helper, unit tests passed)
            *   `CommonEvents.json` reconstructor: COMPLETE (uses `update_value_at_path` for name, `reconstruct_event_command_list` helper for list, unit tests passed)
            *   `Troops.json` reconstructor: COMPLETE (uses `update_value_at_path` for name, `reconstruct_event_command_list` helper for pages, unit tests passed)
            *   `System.json` reconstructor: COMPLETE (uses `update_value_at_path` helper for all fields, unit tests passed)
            *   `MapInfos.json` reconstructor: COMPLETE (uses `update_value_at_path` helper for name, unit tests passed)
            *   `Classes.json` reconstructor: COMPLETE (uses `update_value_at_path` helper for name, note, and learnings notes, unit tests passed)
            *   `States.json` reconstructor: COMPLETE (uses `update_value_at_path` helper for name, note, and messages, unit tests passed)
            *   `MapXXX.json` reconstructor: COMPLETE (uses `update_value_at_path` for event names, `reconstruct_event_command_list` helper for event command lists, unit tests passed)
            *   All planned reconstructors complete (`Tilesets.json` reconstruction deferred as its parsing was deferred).
        *   **Sub-Task 6.5: Implement `serde_json::Value` Navigation/Update Helper (Rust) - COMPLETE - Initial version with basic path handling and tests implemented in `utils/json_utils.rs`**
        *   **Sub-Task 6.6: Implement `reconstruct_event_command_list` Helper (Rust) - COMPLETE - Helper function in `core/rpgmv/common.rs` for reconstructing event command lists, used by `CommonEvents.json` and future event-based files.**
    *   **Task 7: ZIP Archive Creation (Rust): COMPLETE**
        *   Implemented ZIP creation using the `zip` crate (`zip = "4.0.0"` already in `Cargo.toml`).
        *   Created `src-tauri/src/services/zip_service.rs` with `create_zip_archive_from_memory` function.
        *   Unit tests for `zip_service.rs` are passing.
        *   `create_zip_archive_from_memory` takes `HashMap<String, String>` (relative_path: content) and output path.
        *   ZIP structure is Option A (no top-level project folder, `www/data/...` directly at ZIP root).
        *   Updated `reconstruct_translated_project_files` command in `commands/project.rs` to use this service.
        *   Command outputs ZIP to a fixed path (`src-tauri/target/translated_project_output.zip`) for now.
    *   **Task 8: Save & Show Output (Frontend & Rust):**
        *   Planned: Frontend UI ("Export Translated Project" button) enabled after ZIP creation.
        *   Planned: Frontend calls new `save_zip_archive_command` with temporary ZIP path.
        *   Planned: Backend `save_zip_archive_command` (in `commands/project.rs`):
            *   Uses `tauri-plugin-dialog` for user to select save destination/name.
            *   Moves ZIP from temporary path to user-selected path (`std::fs::rename` or copy+delete).
            *   Returns final save path or error/cancellation to frontend.
        *   Planned: Frontend enables "Show in Folder" button on successful save.
        *   Planned: Frontend calls new `open_folder_command` with final save path.
        *   Planned: Backend `open_folder_command` (in `commands/project.rs`) uses `tauri-plugin-opener`.

## Next Major Goals (Adjusted from Implementation Plan):

1.  Complete **RPG Maker MV Project Translation (Batch)** (This is the current primary focus, formerly Phase 3).
2.  (Other phases from the original plan like Glossary, DeepL integration, etc., will follow, their numbering effectively shifted).

## Pending Clarifications / Blockers:
*   User feedback on testing integration within the implementation plan.
*   Answers to outstanding questions (ZIP Path Preservation, DeepL Specifics, Definition of Done).
*   Confirmation of local Ollama setup (Ollama running, `mistral` model pulled) - *Still relevant for batch translation via Ollama*.

## Future Enhancements/Considerations (Deferred from earlier phases):
*   Address double line break issue from Ollama for Japanese translations (deferred from original Phase 2, still relevant if Ollama is used for batch).
*   (Re-introduction of Single-Text Translation feature can be considered later if desired).
*   Detailed UI component structure for the Settings page (Phase 6 of implementation plan) to include `SettingEngines.vue`, `SettingModels.vue`, `SettingLanguages.vue`, and potentially `SettingAppearance.vue` for better organization of user configurations.
