# Project Progress - AI Game Translator

Last Updated: {{Current Date/Time}} <!-- Replace with actual date/time -->

## Overall Status:
Phase 1 (Project Setup & Core UI Shell for Project Translation) is complete. Core technology stack is defined, essential frontend/backend dependencies are configured, Tauri plugins are registered, the basic UI shell for project selection is implemented with Pinia state management (`stores/project.ts`), Nuxt configuration is optimized, and Inter-Process Communication (IPC) between frontend and backend is verified. 

**Single-Text Translation Feature (Phase 2 from original plan) has been REMOVED/DEFERRED to prioritize batch project translation.** The backend Ollama client and associated Tauri command (`translate_text_command`) might be reused or adapted if this feature is re-introduced.

**Backend Refactoring Complete:** The Rust backend command structure has been reorganized. Commands are now in the `src-tauri/src/commands/` directory, with modules like `project.rs` and `translation.rs`. The `translate_text_command` has been moved to `commands::translation` and `lib.rs` updated accordingly.

## Completed Milestones:

*   **Documentation & Planning:** (All initial docs created and updated as needed - will be updated again to reflect removal of single-text translation)
    *   Comprehensive **App Design Document** (`@memory-bank/translator_app_design_document.md`).
    *   **Recommended Tech Stack** (`@memory-bank/recommended_tech_stack.md`).
    *   Initial **Implementation Plan** (`@memory-bank/implementation_plan.md`).
    *   **Architecture Overview** (`@memory-bank/architecture.md`).
    *   **Frontend Architecture** (`@memory-bank/frontend_architecture.md`).
    *   Associated Cursor memory bank rules established and updated.

*   **Phase 1: Project Setup & Core UI Shell (Focus on Project Translation - COMPLETE):**
    *   Basic Nuxt 3 project structure established.
    *   **Frontend Dependencies (`package.json`):** Verified, updated, and refined.
    *   **Backend Dependencies & Setup (`src-tauri`):** Core crates and Tauri plugins configured and registered.
    *   **Nuxt Configuration (`nuxt.config.ts`):** Optimized for Tauri integration, resolved CSS loading issues.
    *   **Core UI Implementation (`pages/index.vue`):** UI for project selection via `ProjectSelector.vue` implemented.
    *   **Frontend State Management (Pinia):** `stores/project.ts` created (Setup Stores) and integrated for project workflow. (`stores/translation.ts` to be reviewed/removed).
    *   **IPC Test:** Successfully verified communication between Nuxt frontend and Rust backend (`simple_ipc_test` command).

*   **Phase 2: Core Single-Text Translation (Offline AI - Ollama) (REMOVED/DEFERRED)**
    *   (Details of completed sub-tasks for this phase are now moot as the feature is deferred. The `translate_text_command` and Ollama client in Rust exist but are not currently used by the frontend.)

*   **Backend Code Structure Refactoring (Part of initiating original Phase 3):**
    *   Created `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` to manage command modules.
    *   Created `src-tauri/src/commands/project.rs` for project-related commands.
    *   Created `src-tauri/src/commands/translation.rs`.
    *   Moved `translate_text_command` from `lib.rs` to `commands::translation::translate_text_command`.
    *   Updated `lib.rs` to declare the `commands` module and correctly reference the moved command in the `invoke_handler`.
    *   Updated `implementation_plan.md` to reflect the new `.rs` file naming convention (e.g., `project.rs` instead of `project_commands.rs`).

*   **Frontend Refactoring - Layout & Header (Part of initiating original Phase 3):**
    *   Created `components/AppHeader.vue` with application title and a placeholder settings button.
    *   Created `layouts/default.vue` and integrated `AppHeader.vue` into it, establishing a basic page structure with a header and main content slot.
    *   Refined `layouts/default.vue` to leverage Nuxt 3's auto-import for components (removed explicit `AppHeader` import).

*   **Frontend Refactoring - Page Structure (Part of initiating original Phase 3 - Now Refocused):**
    *   `components/SingleTextTranslator.vue` and its integration into `pages/index.vue` have been removed.
    *   `components/ProjectSelector.vue` (formerly `ProjectTranslator.vue`) created for project selection.
    *   `pages/index.vue` now focuses on `ProjectSelector.vue`.
*   **Original Phase 3, Task 1: Project Selection (Rust & Frontend) (COMPLETE):**
    *   Implemented `select_project_folder_command` in `src-tauri/src/commands/project.rs`.
    *   Created Pinia store `stores/project.ts` (using Setup Store syntax) with state and actions for folder selection.
    *   Connected store to `components/ProjectTranslator.vue` for UI interaction.
*   **Original Phase 3, Task 2: RPG Maker MV Project Detection (Rust Backend) (COMPLETE):**
    *   Core detection logic moved to `core::game_detection` module.
    *   `select_project_folder_command` returns path and detection result.
    *   Frontend store and component updated to handle and display detection status.
*   **Original Phase 3, Task 3: File Parsing & String Extraction (Rust Backend) (COMPLETE):**
    *   The `extract_project_strings_command` is defined in `commands/project.rs` and registered.
    *   RPG Maker MV parsing module structure implemented in `src-tauri/src/core/rpgmv/`.
    *   All planned RPG Maker MV JSON file parsers (`Actors`, `Items`, `Armors`, `Weapons`, `Skills`, `Enemies`, `CommonEvents`, `Troops`, `System`, `MapXXX`, `MapInfos`, `Classes`, `States`) and associated refactorings for string extraction are implemented. (`Tilesets.json` parsing deferred).
    *   **Integration Testing for Parsers (COMPLETE):**
        *   All Rust integration tests for individual RPG Maker MV JSON file types (`Actors.json`, `Armors.json`, `Classes.json`, `CommonEvents.json`, `Enemies.json`, `Items.json`, `MapInfos.json`, `MapXXX.json`, `Skills.json`, `States.json`, `System.json`, `Troops.json`, `Weapons.json`) have been successfully refactored into separate files under `src-tauri/src/tests/integration/`.
        *   The common helper function `setup_and_extract_all_strings` has been centralized in `src-tauri/src/tests/common_test_utils.rs`.
        *   All 18 tests are confirmed PASSING after these refactorings.

## Current Focus (Effectively New Phase 2):

*   **RPG Maker MV Project Translation (Batch) - (Formerly Phase 3)**
    *   **Task 4: Frontend for Batch Workflow (Refactored - Core Structure COMPLETE):**
        *   `stores/settings.ts` created to manage `languageOptions` and `engineOptions`. **(COMPLETE)**.
        *   `stores/project.ts` focuses on project selection, detection, string extraction, and navigation. Its `$reset()` calls `translationStore.$resetBatchState()`. **(COMPLETE)**.
        *   `stores/translation.ts` focuses on batch translation operation (state, action). (Currently defines shared `TranslatableStringEntry` & `TranslatedStringEntry` interfaces). **(COMPLETE)**.
        *   `pages/index.vue` uses `ProjectSelector.vue`. **(COMPLETE)**.
        *   `ProjectSelector.vue` triggers extraction via `projectStore`. **(COMPLETE)**.
        *   `ProjectStringsReview.vue` uses `projectStore` for strings, `settingsStore` for options, and `translationStore` for batch action/state. **(COMPLETE)**.
        *   `ProjectStringsResult.vue` uses `translationStore` for results. **(COMPLETE)**.
        *   `pages/project.vue` orchestrates review/results using all three stores as needed. **(COMPLETE)**.
    *   **Task 5: Batch Translation Logic (Manual Testing & Refinement - In Progress with refactored UI):**
        *   Currently performing manual testing of the end-to-end project selection, string extraction (auto-triggered), review, batch translation (Ollama), and results display workflow with the new component structure.
        *   String extraction limitations for testing (e.g., `Actors.json` only) can be managed in `src-tauri/src/core/rpgmv/project.rs` as before.
        *   UI for review (`ProjectStringsReview.vue`) and results (`ProjectStringsResult.vue`) is in place.
        *   Prompt quality for translations is noted as an area for future improvement (Phase 6).
        *   Adjustments and refinements to UI/UX and backend logic will be made based on test findings before proceeding to file reconstruction.

## Next Major Goals (Adjusted from Implementation Plan):

1.  Complete **RPG Maker MV Project Translation (Batch)** (This is the current primary focus, formerly Phase 3).
2.  (Other phases from the original plan like Glossary, DeepL integration, etc., will follow, their numbering effectively shifted).

## Pending Clarifications / Blockers:
*   User feedback on testing integration within the implementation plan.
*   Answers to outstanding questions (ZIP Path Preservation, DeepL Specifics, Definition of Done).
*   Confirmation of local Ollama setup (Ollama running, `mistral` model pulled) - *Still relevant for batch translation via Ollama*.

## Future Enhancements/Considerations (Deferred from earlier phases):
*   Address double line break issue from Ollama for Japanese translations (deferred from original Phase 2, still relevant if Ollama is used for batch).
*   (Re-introduction of Single-Text Translation feature can be considered later if desired).
*   Detailed UI component structure for the Settings page (Phase 6 of implementation plan) to include `SettingEngines.vue`, `SettingModels.vue`, `SettingLanguages.vue`, and potentially `SettingAppearance.vue` for better organization of user configurations.
