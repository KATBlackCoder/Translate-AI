# Project Progress - AI Game Translator

Last Updated: {{Current Date/Time}} <!-- Replace with actual date/time -->

## Overall Status:
Phase 1 (Project Setup & Core UI Shell) is complete. Core technology stack is defined, essential frontend/backend dependencies are configured, Tauri plugins are registered, the basic UI shell is implemented with Pinia state management, Nuxt configuration is optimized, and Inter-Process Communication (IPC) between frontend and backend is verified. 

Phase 2 (Core Single-Text Translation with Ollama) is now COMPLETE. The backend Ollama client and Tauri command are functional. The frontend Pinia store and UI components are integrated, allowing successful end-to-end translation. Error handling has been successfully enhanced with Nuxt UI toasts. (A minor formatting issue with double line breaks for Japanese from the Ollama model has been noted and deferred for future consideration).

**Backend Refactoring Complete:** The Rust backend command structure has been reorganized. Commands are now in the `src-tauri/src/commands/` directory, with modules like `project.rs` and `translation.rs`. The `translate_text_command` has been moved to `commands::translation` and `lib.rs` updated accordingly.

## Completed Milestones:

*   **Documentation & Planning:** (All initial docs created and updated as needed)
    *   Comprehensive **App Design Document** (`@memory-bank/translator_app_design_document.md`).
    *   **Recommended Tech Stack** (`@memory-bank/recommended_tech_stack.md`).
    *   Initial **Implementation Plan** (`@memory-bank/implementation_plan.md`).
    *   **Architecture Overview** (`@memory-bank/architecture.md`).
    *   **Frontend Architecture** (`@memory-bank/frontend_architecture.md`).
    *   Associated Cursor memory bank rules established and updated.

*   **Phase 1: Project Setup & Core UI Shell (COMPLETE):**
    *   Basic Nuxt 3 project structure established.
    *   **Frontend Dependencies (`package.json`):** Verified, updated, and refined.
    *   **Backend Dependencies & Setup (`src-tauri`):** Core crates and Tauri plugins configured and registered.
    *   **Nuxt Configuration (`nuxt.config.ts`):** Optimized for Tauri integration, resolved CSS loading issues.
    *   **Core UI Implementation (`pages/index.vue`):** Functional UI for single-text translation implemented.
    *   **Frontend State Management (Pinia):** `stores/translation.ts` created (Setup Stores) and integrated.
    *   **IPC Test:** Successfully verified communication between Nuxt frontend and Rust backend (`simple_ipc_test` command).

*   **Phase 2: Core Single-Text Translation (Offline AI - Ollama) (COMPLETE)**
    *   **Ollama Client (Rust):** Fully implemented in `src-tauri/src/ollama_client.rs`, including request/response handling and prompt construction. Behavior with Japanese romanization (using `mistral` model) noted.
    *   **Tauri Command:** `translate_text_command` is created, registered in the backend, and calls the Ollama client.
    *   **Frontend Store Integration:** `stores/translation.ts` updated to correctly call `translate_text_command` via `invoke` within the `handleTranslate` action.
    *   **UI Component Integration:** `pages/index.vue` fully connected to `stores/translation.ts` using `storeToRefs` and direct action calls, enabling interaction with state and triggering translation. (Dropdown issue resolved by using `:items` prop instead of `:options` and `value-key` instead of `value-attribute` for `USelectMenu`).
    *   **End-to-End Testing (Manual):** Core translation functionality verified as per `phase_2_manual_testing.md`. Successful translations and basic error propagation (to target text area) confirmed.
    *   **UI Error Handling (Toasts):** Integrated Nuxt UI `useToast` in `stores/translation.ts` to display errors from the backend translation command, clearing the target text area on error. (Note: Toast visibility uses the `duration` prop, currently relying on the 5000ms default). Testing confirmed toasts appear correctly for errors.

*   **Backend Code Structure Refactoring (Part of initiating Phase 3):**
    *   Created `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` to manage command modules.
    *   Created `src-tauri/src/commands/project.rs` for project-related commands.
    *   Created `src-tauri/src/commands/translation.rs`.
    *   Moved `translate_text_command` from `lib.rs` to `commands::translation::translate_text_command`.
    *   Updated `lib.rs` to declare the `commands` module and correctly reference the moved command in the `invoke_handler`.
    *   Updated `implementation_plan.md` to reflect the new `.rs` file naming convention (e.g., `project.rs` instead of `project_commands.rs`).

*   **Frontend Refactoring - Layout & Header (Part of initiating Phase 3):**
    *   Created `components/AppHeader.vue` with application title and a placeholder settings button.
    *   Created `layouts/default.vue` and integrated `AppHeader.vue` into it, establishing a basic page structure with a header and main content slot.
    *   Refined `layouts/default.vue` to leverage Nuxt 3's auto-import for components (removed explicit `AppHeader` import).

*   **Frontend Refactoring - Page Structure (Part of initiating Phase 3):**
    *   Created `components/SingleTextTranslator.vue` and moved single-text translation UI and logic into it from `pages/index.vue`.
    *   Created `components/ProjectTranslator.vue` with placeholder content and the "Select Project Folder" button.
    *   Updated `pages/index.vue` to be a container page, using `SingleTextTranslator` and `ProjectTranslator` components, each within its own `UCard`.
*   **Phase 3, Task 1: Project Selection (Rust & Frontend) (COMPLETE):**
    *   Implemented `select_project_folder_command` in `src-tauri/src/commands/project.rs`.
    *   Created Pinia store `stores/project.ts` (using Setup Store syntax) with state and actions for folder selection.
    *   Connected store to `components/ProjectTranslator.vue` for UI interaction.
*   **Phase 3, Task 2: RPG Maker MV Project Detection (Rust Backend) (COMPLETE):**
    *   Core detection logic moved to `core::game_detection` module.
    *   `select_project_folder_command` returns path and detection result.
    *   Frontend store and component updated to handle and display detection status.
*   **Phase 3, Task 3: File Parsing & String Extraction (Rust Backend) (COMPLETE):**
    *   The `extract_project_strings_command` is defined in `commands/project.rs` and registered.
    *   RPG Maker MV parsing module structure implemented in `src-tauri/src/core/rpgmv/`.
    *   All planned RPG Maker MV JSON file parsers (`Actors`, `Items`, `Armors`, `Weapons`, `Skills`, `Enemies`, `CommonEvents`, `Troops`, `System`, `MapXXX`, `MapInfos`, `Classes`, `States`) and associated refactorings for string extraction are implemented. (`Tilesets.json` parsing deferred).
    *   **Integration Testing for Parsers (COMPLETE):**
        *   All Rust integration tests for individual RPG Maker MV JSON file types (`Actors.json`, `Armors.json`, `Classes.json`, `CommonEvents.json`, `Enemies.json`, `Items.json`, `MapInfos.json`, `MapXXX.json`, `Skills.json`, `States.json`, `System.json`, `Troops.json`, `Weapons.json`) have been successfully refactored into separate files under `src-tauri/src/tests/integration/`.
        *   The common helper function `setup_and_extract_all_strings` has been centralized in `src-tauri/src/tests/common_test_utils.rs`.
        *   All 18 tests are confirmed PASSING after these refactorings.

## Current Focus:

*   **Phase 3: RPG Maker MV Project Translation (Batch)**
    *   **Task 4: Frontend for Batch Workflow (In Progress):**
        *   Define `TranslatableStringEntry` interface directly in `stores/project.ts` (can be moved to `types/project.ts` in a future refactor).
        *   Enhance `stores/project.ts` (Pinia Store):
            *   Add new state properties: `isLoadingExtractedStrings: ref(false)`, `extractedStrings: ref<TranslatableStringEntry[]>([])`, `extractionError: ref<string | null>(null)`.
            *   Add new action `extractProjectStrings` to invoke backend, handle loading states, and update store with results or errors (using toasts for errors).
        *   Update `components/ProjectTranslator.vue` (Vue Component):
            *   Add "Extract Strings" button (conditionally enabled, calls store action).
            *   Display loading indicator tied to `isLoadingExtractedStrings`.
            *   Display errors from `extractionError`.
            *   Display extracted strings summary (e.g., count) and details (e.g., in a `UTable`).
            *   Add a placeholder "Start Batch Translation" button.

## Next Major Goals (from Implementation Plan):

1.  Complete **Phase 2: Core Single-Text Translation (Offline AI - Ollama / `mistral`)**. (DONE)
2.  Complete **Phase 3: RPG Maker MV Project Translation (Batch)**.

## Pending Clarifications / Blockers:
*   User feedback on testing integration within the implementation plan.
*   Answers to outstanding questions (ZIP Path Preservation, DeepL Specifics, Definition of Done).
*   Confirmation of local Ollama setup (Ollama running, `mistral` model pulled).

## Future Enhancements/Considerations (Deferred from earlier phases):
*   Address double line break issue from Ollama for Japanese translations (deferred from Phase 2).
