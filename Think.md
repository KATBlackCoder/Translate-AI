In my app, there something who must be done : in @ProjectStringsResult.vue , when I click on "Reconstruct & Package Project" that call the handleReconstructAndPackage method. that method use the invoke reconstruct_translated_project_files from the back in @project.rs . now in this file, we have a function target_dir who create a new folder for the temp file. and when the save_zip_archive_command methode is call, he will remove the temp file. Now here my idea. can make that, since the objectif behind is when we click on "Reconstruct & Package Project" is to create the zip and save in the folder
